## 🏭 Section 2: Smart Manufacturing Case Study

[**View Section 2**](section2.md)

A comprehensive AI Agent implementation strategy for AutoParts Inc., addressing critical manufacturing challenges.

### Business Challenges Addressed:
- 15% defect rate in precision components
- Unpredictable machine downtime
- Rising labor costs
- Increasing customization demands

### Proposed Solution: Multi-Agent Architecture

#### Three Specialized AI Agents:

1. **Quality Inspector Agent**
   - Technology: Computer Vision (YOLOv11/EfficientNet) + LLM reasoning
   - Impact: Defect reduction from 15% → <4%
   - Response time: <300ms inline inspection

2. **Predictive Maintenance Agent**
   - Technology: Time-series ML (Prophet + LSTM) + IoT sensor fusion
   - Impact: 35-45% downtime reduction
   - Prediction window: 48-96 hours ahead with >92% accuracy

3. **Customization Orchestrator Agent**
   - Technology: Generative AI + MES/ERP integration
   - Impact: Changeover time from days → <2 hours
   - Natural language processing for customer requests

### Financial Impact:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Investment** | $620K-$850K |
| **Annual Benefits** | $5.35M-$5.75M |
| **Payback Period** | 4-6 months |
| **3-Year ROI** | 620-780% |

### Implementation Timeline:
- **Months 1-3**: Pilot on two production lines
- **Months 4-7**: Full rollout + Customization Orchestrator
- **Months 8-12**: Optimization and standardization

### Key Features:
- ✅ Comprehensive risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Ethical AI governance framework
- ✅ Technical, organizational, and cybersecurity safeguards
- ✅ Live workflow simulation on make.com

**Total Word Count**: 678 words
